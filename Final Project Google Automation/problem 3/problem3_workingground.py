This is problem 3 for course 6 of the python cert
I will try to keep the same format, several blocks that include cases/scenerios that slowly
ramp up in difficulty/complexity.

Problem Description:
Using a JSON file that includes sales data, fill in the script as needed so that it accomplishes the following:
    1. Which car model had the most sales
    (hint says call format_car method for this)
    
    2. Calculate the most popular car_year across all make/models.
    (i.e. find how many cars were sold in each year and out of those which was the most)

Using the conclusions found to 1 and 2, construct a PDF report that details this and send it to the given email/details

#setting email headers

sender = "me@example.com"

message["From"] = sender
message["To"] = recipient
message["Subject"] = subject

#setting body of email

body = '''This is a body
            of an email that could be as
            long as you want it to be'''
            
message.set_content(body)

#Below will be setting up to attach a file

attach_path = "C:\\Users\\ADP55\\Desktop\\testfolder\\gobble.jpg"

#Below sets up a way for us to get the mimetype and subtype that will need to be set
#before we can send the message

attach_filename = os.path.basename(attach_path)

#I'm not sure why they recommend/use the underscore below when setting a variable

mime_type, _ = mimetypes.guess_type(attach_path)

#this is a little trick to redefine them quickly

mime_type,mime_subtype = mime_type.split('/',1)

#now we can finally attach the picture/file to the message
#notice we needed the path to open the file, then
#to attach we needed: read the file, maintype(which is mime_type), subtype(which is mime_subtype,
#and the filename

with open(attach_path, 'rb') as ap:
    
    message.add_attachment(ap.read(),
                           maintype=mime_type,

                           filename=attach_filename)

#Adding a file will add a HUGE string when printing message, shorten it in oneway or another

#Below are the info to set for the smtp site for outgoing messages, and a password asker to use later

smtp_site = input("what is the smtp address to use")

mail_pass = getpass.getpass("password? ")

#now that we have that info we can open a server using the smtp site, setting debug to 1 is on to see
#debug info

mail_server = smtplib.SMTP_SSL(smtp_site)
mail_server.set_debuglevel(1)

#authenticates the connection using the username (email of sender) and password
#it will ouput a tuple that will have a status code and message

#Note!!! If this autentication fails it will raise a SMTPAuthenticationError exception, you'll need
#to figure out a way to handle those!

mail_server.login(sender, mail_pass)

#finally the message with attachments is sent via the smtp server and then closed upon completion

mail_server.send_message(message)
