#%% Day 8 Bite 26: Dictionary Comprehensions are Awesome
'''
A dictionary comprehension is like a list comprehension, but it constructs a dict instead of a list. 
They are convenient to quickly operate on each (key, value) pair of a dict.
 And often in one line of code, maybe two after checking PEP8 ;)

We think they are elegant, that's why we want you to know about them!

In this Bite you are given a dict and a set. 
Write a dictionary comprehension that filters out the items in the set and returns the resulting dict,
 so if your dict is 
 {1: 'bob', 2: 'julian', 3: 'tim'}
 and your set is {2, 3},
 the resulting dict would be {1: 'bob'}.

Check out the tests for more details. Have fun!

#%% Day 9 Bite 29: Martin's IQ Test
'''
Martin is preparing to pass an IQ test.

The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given characters differs from the others. 
He observed that one char usually differs from the others in being alphanumeric or not.

Please help Martin! To check his answers, 
he needs a program to find the different one (the alphanumeric among non-alphanumerics or vice versa) 
among the given characters.

Complete get_index_different_char to meet this goal. 
It receives a chars list and returns an int index (zero-based).

Just to be clear, alphanumeric == abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789

Examples:

['A', 'f', '.', 'Q', 2]  # returns index 2 (dot is non-alphanumeric among alphanumerics)
['.', '{', ' ^', '%', 'a']  # returns index 4 ('a' is alphanumeric among non-alphanumerics)   
'''

    '''Returns the index of the odd char out. Chars are organized by alphanumeric or not, whichever rarer return the index.'''

    alphanum = ''
    nonalphanum = ''
    #these are the counters, for each char found in each group add one to the counter
    
    alpha_i = 0 
    nonalpha_i = 0
    
    #next check the list given and see which of those are alnum or not, and then iterate resp counter
    
    for char in chars:
        if str(char).isalnum():
            alpha_i += 1

        else:

            nonalphanum = char
    #finally, whichever counter is lower return that most recent char

#%% Day 10 Bite 32: Don't let mutability fool you
'''
In this Bite you are presented with a function that copies
 the given items data structure.

There is a problem though, the tests fail. Can you fix it?

This can be done in a one liner. 
If you know which module to use it will be easy,
 if not you will learn something new today.

Regardless we want you to think about Python's mutability.
 Have fun!

import copy

This excerise has made me advertently fall into a classic
pitfall in programming. 

Actually its made me fall into two, but one that I have been
making and just now realized.

The first pitfall:
It's about the concept of greedy importing, typically when I
import new functions/libraries/packages I have been importing
the full package/library when in reality it is much
more effiecient and faster to import only the one you need.
example
import copy     #very greedy, imports all from copy

vs

from copy import deepcopy  #only imports what we need, shorter
                                notation too!

The second pitfall:
From dvr on stackoverflow:
This is programming 101. Remember lists are stored in heap,
with pointers to them.

So really the variable board points to the place
in heap where that array is stored, when you assign
temp (or another vaiable name to a list),
you are making a new pointer which points to the same
array in memory.

This is a concept known as shallow copyiing, we have
two different ways to combat this problem,
1. Utilizing the package copy creating a deep copy.
2. Using the code that dvr created, which is most likely the 
source or near the source of copy.

example from dvr
def deep_copy(board):
    temp = []
    for i in range(len(board)):
        row_copy = []
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            row_copy.append(board[i][j])
        temp.append(row_copy)
    return temp
